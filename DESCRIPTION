Description: Calculate agrometeorological variables for crops
             including growing degree days (McMaster, GS & Wilhelm, WW
             (1997) <doi:10.1016/S0168-1923(97)00027-0>), cumulative
             rainfall, number of stress days and cumulative or mean
             radiation and evaporation. Convert dates to day of year
             and vice versa. Also, download curated and interpolated
             Australian weather data from the Queensland Government
             DES longpaddock website
