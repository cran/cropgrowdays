The `crop` dataset consists of dates for a hypothetical crop data set
which would also usually contain agronomic traits of interest such as
yield, dry matter yield and so on. Each row of data contains sowing,
flowering and harvest dates for a typical field or farm in Queensland,
Australia.

```{r, crop-dataframe}
## crop data object
print(crop, n=5)
